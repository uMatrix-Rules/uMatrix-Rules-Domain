My own rules

### Note:

- I can only ensure most site functions are workable. Use at your own risk.
- If you are expecting my investigation on any specific site, pls open a [new issue](https://github.com/Rictusempra/uMatrix-Rules/issues/new):
    - give a specific URL
    - point out your uMatrix version & broswer version
    - attach your own rules and, if differ from default, your preferences
- Here are service inavailablity things that won't be fixed:
    -  from contents blocked by any built-in subscriptions
    - caused by certain preferences outside of rule sets
    - if a site is using cert from any untrusted CA
    - relevant with plugin, such as Adobe Flash
    - other issues you should have learnt from [uMatrix README](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/blob/master/README.md)
